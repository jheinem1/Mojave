In order to edit, make sure you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

To install roblox-ts, follow [this tutorial](https://roblox-ts.com/docs/setup-guide).

It also helps to have these vscode extensions:

- <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Roblox-TS.vscode-roblox-ts>
- <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evaera.vscode-rojo>

You also want these studio plugins:
